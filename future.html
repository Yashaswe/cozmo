      <h2>Future Steps</h2>
      <p>
        It is possible that our approach would not be as successful in other
        environments. We suggest tuning some of the various parameters including
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the size of the pose population</li>
        <li>the number of pictures taken to get the robot’s bearings</li>
        <li>
          the distance between pictures taken during the localization process
        </li>
        <li>
          The process for selecting a position given updated information after
          iterations of the localization process
        </li>
        <li>
          How image differences are turned into relative probabilities: We used
          an approach that multiplies the square differences of the reciprocals
          by the exponential of the squared differences divided by the sensor
          variance. Admittedly, we took this from the previous group without
          fully thinking about it since it seemed to work for our purposes.
          Maybe this could be made better by trying different approaches which
          might make the robot’s beliefs converge faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the sliding window process, the degree increments between each
          offset image. Currently, we shift it by 10 pixels each time. The
          endpoints of this process (-90px to 90px) could also be tuned to make
          our approach more efficient.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maybe our approach could be made faster by downscaling images. We did
          not experiment with this, but presumably, it could speed up the
          process if this was implemented. We do not know how this would affect
          the efficacy of our method.
